# 🧩 Bias Guard Summary for Copilot-Integrated Development

In the context of this project—where editorial integrity, auditability, and safe automation are paramount—a bias guard serves as a **trust layer** between Copilot-generated suggestions and the final output. Its role is to **intercept, evaluate, and log** any potentially biased content before it enters the changelog, macro logic, or diagnostic reports.

## Alignment with Development Principles

- 🛡️ **Editorial Protection**: Flags biased phrasing without altering punctuation or meaningful text.
- 📋 **Audit-Friendly Logging**: Outputs ASCII-only diagnostics with session-aware context for manual review.
- 🧠 **Purpose-Aware Filtering**: Evaluates whether Copilot’s suggestions align with the ethical and functional goals of the automation tools.
- 🔍 **Suffix & Context Sensitivity**: Differentiates between technical terms and socially loaded language (e.g., `NativeClient` vs `native intelligence`).
- 🔄 **Modular Integration**: Embeds between Copilot output and macro execution, acting as a preflight check for fairness and compliance.

This guard doesn’t just catch bias—it **documents intent**, supports reproducibility, and reinforces the commitment to safe, explainable automation.

📖 **Documentation**: See the [BiasGuard GitHub repository](https://github.com/mruxsaksriskul/biasguard) for architecture, reasoning engine details, CI/CD integration, and fairness specifications.
