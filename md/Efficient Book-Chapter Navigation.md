# üìò Efficient Book-Chapter Navigation with Pre-Indexed Lookup Table

Great concept, Peter. What you‚Äôre describing is a **pre-indexed lookup table** for Book/Chapter navigation, which transforms a slow linear scan into a fast, direct access operation. Let‚Äôs break down how this improves performance and how to implement it efficiently.

---

## üìò Structure: Heading 1 = Book, Heading 2 = Chapter

You‚Äôre building a 66√óN matrix:

- **Rows**: Each Heading 1 (e.g., `GENESIS`, `EXODUS`, ‚Ä¶ `REVELATION`)
- **Columns**: Each Heading 2 (e.g., `CHAPTER 1` to `CHAPTER N`)
- **Values**: The paragraph index of the Heading 2 marker

So `"Rev 20"` becomes:

```vb
Dim paraIndex As Long
paraIndex = lookup("REVELATION", 20)
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(paraIndex).Range.Select
```

## üöÄ Performance Gains

### üîç Current Method: Linear Scan

- Scans every paragraph until it finds `"Heading 1"` and `"Heading 2"`
- Cost: O(n), where n = total paragraphs
- Slow in large documents (10k+ paragraphs)

### ‚ö° Proposed Method: Pre-indexed Lookup

- Lookup `"REVELATION"` row, then column 20
- Cost: O(1) access if stored in memory
- Near-instant navigation

## üß† Storage Options

| Format           | Description                     | Speed    | Persistence |
|------------------|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| VBA Dictionary   | `Dict("REVELATION")(20) = 16620` | Fastest  | Memory only |
| 2D Array         | `bookChapters(65, 19) = 16620`   | Fast     | Memory only |
| CSV File         | `"REVELATION",20,16620`          | Medium   | Persistent  |
| JSON/XML         | Structured, readable             | Slower   | Persistent  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Sketch (Memory Buffer)

```vb
Dim bookIndex As Object
Set bookIndex = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")

Dim chapterDict As Object
Set chapterDict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")

chapterDict.Add 20, 16620
bookIndex.Add "REVELATION", chapterDict

' Lookup
Dim paraIndex As Long
paraIndex = bookIndex("REVELATION")(20)
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(paraIndex).Range.Select
```

---

## üß™ How This Helps

- Eliminates repeated scans for verse navigation
- Enables instant jumps for macros like `GoToVerseSBL`
- Supports audit-friendly logging (e.g., `"Rev 20 ‚Üí ¬∂16620"`)

Would you like help building the initial index from the document‚Äîscanning all Heading 1 and Heading 2 markers and writing them to a CSV or memory buffer? I can also help wrap this into a reusable `BookChapterIndex` module.

Let me know if you want this wrapped in a GitHub README template or need help integrating it into a repo structure.
